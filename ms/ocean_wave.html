<h2>Ocean Wave Family</h2>
<p>Ocean wave is a formation of three or more dancers
holding adjacent hands and with each dancer facing in an opposite direction to that of the
adjoining dancer(s).</p>

<ul>
<li><b>MINI WAVE</b> is an ocean wave consisting of two dancers.</li>

<li><b>RIGHT HAND WAVE</b>: An ocean wave with an even number of dancers is a right-hand wave if the end dancers
and the dancers adjacent to them have right hands jointed.</li>

<li><b>LEFT HAND WAVE</b>: An ocean
wave with an even number of dancers is a left-hand wave if the end dancers and the dancers
adjacent to them have left hands joined.</li>

<li>
<b>ALAMO STYLE WAVE</b>: Alamo style is a formation
of an even number of dancers in a circle holding adjacent hands and with each dancer
facing in an opposite direction to that of the adjoining dancers.</li>
</ul>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-latin">
<li>
<b>STEP TO A WAVE</b>: Starting formation - facing dancers.
Dancers &frac12; Pass Thru (i.e. walk forward a small step and make a mini-wave). Ending
formation is a right-hand mini-wave. Usually STEP TO A WAVE is called from facing couples,
ending in a right-hand ocean wave.</li>

<li><b>WAVE BALANCE</b>:
Starting formation - mini-wave, ocean wave. Each dancer steps forward and pauses while
bringing the other foot forward and touching it to the floor without transferring weight.
Each steps back on the free foot and pauses while touching the other foot beside it.</li>
</ol>

<p class="styling">STYLING: Dancers should use  hands-up position. Forward distance between dancers should be determined by the arm position of the dancer which is extended forward and bent slightly at the elbow. Care should be taken not to pull down on the partner's arm. In the Ocean Wave Balance, hands should never come behind the shoulders. Step forward touch, step back touch. Or, as a pleasing variation, use a two-step (step, close, step, hold) forward and a two-step (step, close, step, hold) back. Hands may be used to resist forward motion to prevent stepping through too far.</p>
<p class="timing">Timing: One balance forward and back, 4 steps.</p>
