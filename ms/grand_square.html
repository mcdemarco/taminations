<h2>Grand Square</h2>
<p>Starting formation - square. A call that has the sides doing one
part while at the same time the heads are doing another.
<span id="Part1">Heads move
forward into the square (4 steps), turning one quarter (90&deg;) on the
fourth step to face partners</span>
<span id="Part2">and back away to the sides of the square
(4 steps). Turn one quarter (90&deg;) to face the original opposites.</span>
<span id="Part3">Back away to the corners of the square (4 steps)
and turn one quarter (90&deg;)
to face original partners</span>
<span id="Part4">and walk forward to home (4 steps).</span> Do not
turn. (Total to here: 16 steps.) From this point the action is
reversed.
<span id="Part5">Heads back away from their partners (4 steps), turning one
quarter (90&deg;) on the fourth step</span> and
<span id="Part6">walk forward to the opposites (4
steps). Turn one quarter</span> and
<span id="Part7">walk forward into the center toward
partners (4 steps). Turn one quarter (90&deg;) to face opposites</span> and
<span id="Part8">back up to home</span> (total: 32 steps).
While the head couples are doing the
first 16 steps, the sides start by facing their partners to back away
and do the second 16 steps. Completing this, the sides do the first 16
steps, while the heads are doing the last 16. The principle of walking
three steps and then turning (or reversing) on the fourth step is
followed throughout. This call may be broken into fractional parts by
the caller directing the number of steps required. The call may also
start with the heads, or other designated dancers, directed to
face. </p>
<p class="styling">STYLING: Men's' arms in natural dance position; ladies work skirt with natural swinging action. When moving forward and backward as a couple, normal couple handhold is desired.</p>
<p class="timing">Timing: 32 counts.</p>
