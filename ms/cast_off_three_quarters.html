in a Couple turn, as a unit, away from the center of the line for 3/4 of a circle (270 degrees).</p></div>

<div class="styling"><b>Styling</b>
<p>Dancers who are partners maintain current handholds throughout the call.</p>
<p>From Completed Double Pass Thru, the combination Centers In, Cast Off 3/4 has often been danced
with linked elbows. This styling is discouraged because Centers In is not always followed by Cast Off
3/4.</p></div>

<div class="comments"><b>Comments</b>
<p>A couple on the outside of the set (e.g., after Couples Circulate 1 1/2) can be asked to Cast Off
3/4. In this case, they assume the other half of their line is towards the center of the set and do the call.</p>
<p>It is improper to Sweep a Quarter after Cast Off 3/4.</p>
<p>In the dance action from a Couple, there has been controversy about the location of the "pivot point",
the center of the turning. Traditionally the end dancer was the pivot, around which the center dancer
walked 3/4 of a circle, much like &quot;pushing&quot; open a garden gate. This was problematic in certain cases
(e.g., from a Two-Faced Line), because it didn't explain why the call ended with couples facing directly.
The current definition deemphasizes the pivot point; as long as dancers turn in the correct direction
and end in the correct formation, they are dancing the call properly.</p>
<p>From a Tidal Line or Tidal Two-Faced Line, the proper dance action of Cast Off 3/4 is to work on each
side, ending in an Eight Chain Thru formation. From a Tidal Line only, if the caller wants each side
to work as a unit, ending in Facing Lines, &quot;Line of 8, Cast Off 3/4&quot; may be used, similar to
&quot;Line of 8, Bend The Line&quot; (#20.b);
this variation (or the one from a line of 6) is seldom used.</p>
<p>For variations of Cast Off with fractions other than 3/4,
see &quot;Part 4: Additional Detail: Commands: Extensions like Reverse Wheel Around&quot;.</p>
