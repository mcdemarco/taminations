  <h2>Ladies Chain Family</h2>

  <p>The general action of Ladies Chain has two or more women each
    leave their current man, star (or right pull by) with each other, and
    be courtesy turned by a man. The caller indicates which women are
    involved and how far they star.</p>

  <h3>Two Ladies Chain (Regular &amp; 3/4)</h3>
  <p>This definition covers the regular Two Ladies Chain. Two Ladies
    Chain 3/4 is described in the comments section.</p>

    <p>From a squared set with the men at home, Head Ladies Chain is
      danced by those currently at the Heads position, even if this
      involves the original Side women (e.g., after Four Ladies Chain 3/4).</p>
    <p>The next four comments refer to uncommon or regional
      applications of Ladies Chain and may require workshopping.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>From a Squared Set, on the call Head Ladies Chain 3/4, often
        called as “Head Ladies Chain 3/4, Side Men Turn Them”, the head
        women will do their part of a Four Ladies Chain 3/4 (see below)
        using a 2-dancer star. The Courtesy Turn will be with the side men,
        and the ending position will be lines of 3 (boy, girl, girl) at the
        sides of the set with lonesome head men at the heads of the set. The
        timing of this application is 10.</li>
      <li>From a Squared Set, "Head Ladies Chain Right" or "Head
        Ladies to the Right, Chain" has each Head couple work with the Side
        couple on their right. These couples momentarily face, do the call,
        and then adjust back to a Squared Set. Head Ladies Chain Right is
        the same as Side Ladies Chain Left.</li>
      <li>From Facing Lines, “End Ladies Chain on a Diagonal” has the
        right-end women chain with each other, to be Courtesy Turned by the
        adjacent men, ending in Facing Lines.</li>
      <li>From Facing Tandems with women in front, the variation "On A
        Double Track, Ladies Chain" can be used: the women Right Pull By and
        Courtesy Turn with the far man. For example, Couples Circulate, Tag
        the Line, Cloverleaf, On a Double Track, Ladies Chain. This may also
        be called as "Single File, Ladies Chain".</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="styling">
    <b>Styling</b>Men use the Two Ladies Chain styling. Women use a palm
    or finger tip star. If at least two women are wearing full skirts, an
    elegant variation is for each lady to pick up and hold a bit of the
    right edge of her skirt, or an arm's length of a long skirt, as she
    reaches into the star. This arm's-length hold can be continued through
    the Courtesy Turn at a comfortable height and longer if the next call
    is Chain Them Back.
  </div>

  <div class="comments">
    <b>Comments</b><p>Four Ladies Chain is improper if any couple is
    sashayed or same-sex.</p>
    <p>Some callers use Four Ladies Chain from normal
    facing lines. This is danced as if all couples were directly facing
    the center of the set except that it ends in the same facing lines. In
    some areas this is an extended application, and in other areas it is
    considered a gimmick. (See &quot;Part 4: Additional Detail: Commands:
    Gimmicks&quot;.)</p>
