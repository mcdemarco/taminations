<h2>Courtesy Turn</h2>

<p>Courtesy Turn involves a turning movement with a characteristic handhold and finishes with a couple
facing in. It is mainly used to define and teach calls like Ladies Chain, Chain Down The Line, Right and
Left Thru, Do Paso, and Eight Chain Thru. Occasionally it is used as a call by itself.</p>

<div class="starting-formations"><b>Starting formation</b> a Couple (at Basic and Mainstream, a Normal Couple only), or a man and a woman
who are facing</div>

<div class="command-examples"><b>Command examples</b>
<p>Heads Pass Thru; Courtesy Turn</p>
<p>(from facing lines) Pass Thru; Tag The Line In; Turn Thru; Courtesy Turn</p>

<p>(from a completed double pass thru with ladies in the lead) Cloverleaf; four women in the center Square
Thru 3; men reach out and Courtesy Turn this girl</p>
</div>

<div class="dance-action"><b>Dance action</b> <p>A couple works as a unit and turns around with the left-side dancer backing up and
right-side dancer walking forward. The turning point is halfway between the dancers. Facing dancers
blend into a Normal Couple as they perform this action.</p>
<p>The amount of turning is governed by the following rules below or may be given explicitly. If the rules
are contradictory or none apply, then the amount must be given explicitly.</p>
<ol>
<li>A couple that has other dancers behind it turns 180 degrees to end facing the other dancers.</li>
<li>Dancers working on the outside of the set turn to end facing the center of the set.</li>
<li>If an inactive, outside man is facing in, with an active woman coming towards him, then the couple
turns to face the direction in which the inactive man had been facing.</li>
</ol></div>

<div class="ending-formation"><b>Ending formation</b>
Couple facing in (to their group of 4 or the center of the set)</div>

<div class="timing"><b>Timing</b> 4</div>

<div class="styling"><b>Styling</b>
<p>The woman's left hand (palm down) and man's left hand (palm up) are joined.</p>
<p>Right hands are placed according to the woman's choice. If she places her right hand behind her right
hip, palm out, then the man places his right hand in hers without grasping it, leaving these hands
available for the next call. If she uses her right hand to work her skirt, then the man places his right
hand in the small of the back (i.e., in the center).</p></div>

<div class="comments"><b>Comments</b> <p>Dancers who begin as a couple usually do not already have a couple handhold, because their
left hands are not both available and it would be difficult to use the Courtesy Turn handhold. For
example after Couples Circulate, the call Leaders Courtesy Turn is awkward; Leaders Wheel Around
is preferred.</p>
<p>The turning amount can be given explicitly either by the final facing direction (e.g., &quot;to face back in&quot;),
or the total distance, or both (e.g., &quot;Centers go a full turn around to face the outside 2&quot;).
The phrase &quot;and A Quarter More&quot; can be used after Courtesy Turn or a call ending with Courtesy Turn
(e.g., Right And Left Thru And A Quarter More). The couple turns an extra 90 degrees, generally
ending in a Right-Hand Two-Faced Line.</p>
<p>Calls that end in a Squared Set with a Courtesy Turn (e.g., 4 Ladies Chain or Do Paso) can easily blend
into a left arm turn or into an Allemande Thar. For example, &quot;4 Ladies Chain; Chain Them Back with
a Do Paso&quot;. See &quot;Part 4: Additional Detail: Blending one call into another&quot;.</p></div>
