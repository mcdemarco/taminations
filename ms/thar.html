<h2>THAR FAMILY</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-latin">
  
<li>
<b>ALLEMANDE THAR</b>: An allemande thar star is a formation and
may be formed at the end of any left arm turn by the center dancers (or those directed)
forming a right hand box star and backing up. Each outside dancer holds the left forearm
of a center dancer and walks forward.</li>

  
<li>
<b>WRONG WAY THAR</b>: A wrong way thar may be formed
at the end of any right arm turn by the center dancers (or those directed) forming a left
hand box star and backing up. Outside dancers hold the right forearm of a center dancer
and walk forward.</li>

  
<li>
<b>ALLEMANDE LEFT TO AN ALLEMANDE THAR</b>: Starting formation -
anywhere an allemande left is legal. All do an allemande left, blending into a right and left
grand circle. All right pull by and left arm turn &frac12; the next to an ALLEMANDE THAR (men
will be the centers).<br />
To avoid confusion with the call "ALLEMANDE THAR" or "MAKE A THAR", the caller almost
always says words like "ALLEMANDE LEFT TO AN ALLEMANDE THAR, GO FORWARD 2,
MEN SWING IN WITH A BACKUP STAR", or "ALLEMANDE LEFT, GO ALLEMANDE
THAR, WITH A RIGHT AND LEFT AND THE 4 MEN STAR".</li>

</ol>
<p>After a <a href="shoot_the_star.html">SHOOT THE STAR</a>, the caller can say "TO ANOTHER THAR". This is the same
action as "TO AN ALLEMANDE THAR" above. All right pull by and left arm turn &frac12; the next
to an ALLEMANDE THAR. The caller will almost always direct "GO FORWARD 2".</p>
<p>The caller can direct FORWARD (everyone progressing in normal
<a href="right_and_left_grand.html">Right And Left Grand</a>
direction) or BACK or BACKWARD (everyone going the opposite direction from a normal
Right And Left Grand) any number of hands. For example, "SHOOT THE STAR FULL
TURN, GO BACKWARD 3, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, MEN SWING IN MAKE A WRONG-WAY
THAR".</p>
<p>Some callers use FORWARD to mean "the direction you are facing" and never use the words
BACK or BACKWARD. Either usage is acceptable.</p>
<p class="styling">STYLING: When the men are in the center backing up, their right hands will form a  packsaddle/box star, taking the wrist of the man in front of him. When the ladies star, they will simply touch hands in the center. The dancers forming the star must remember to allow those on the outside to set the pace, since they have to travel a much further distance. If the centers move too fast, the result is that those on the outside will have to run to maintain the pace. As in any star, the ladies, while on the outside, may elect to hold their skirts.</p>
<p class="timing">Timing: SS, from allemande left to point of backup star, 12 steps.</p>
