<h2>Run Family</h2>
<p>Starting formation - any two-dancer formation in which the
directed dancer has a shoulder directly adjacent to the other dancer. <b> GENERAL
RULE</b>: The
directed (active) dancer moves forward in a semi-circle (180&deg;) around an adjacent
(inactive) dancer to end in the adjacent dancer's starting position. Meanwhile, the
inactive dancer, who may be facing in any direction, adjusts by stepping (without changing
facing direction) into the vacated starting position of the active dancer. The active
dancer doing the run has reversed his original facing direction. If the direction to run
is not specified (right or left) and if the active dancer has an inactive dancer on each
side, then centers run around ends and ends run around centers. Runs from an alamo circle
are to the right unless otherwise directed. </p>
<ul>
  
<li>
<b>BOYS RUN, GIRLS RUN, ENDS RUN, CENTERS RUN</b>: The directed (active) dancers run around the inactive dancers using the
general rule.</li>
  
<li>
<b>CROSS RUN</b>: Starting formation - line, two-faced line, or wave. Each of
the two directed (active) dancers, who must both be either centers or ends, run into the
spot vacated by the farthest inactive dancer. If the inactive dancers are centers, they
sidestep to become ends; if they are ends, they sidestep to become centers. When the
active dancers are both facing the same direction, they move forward in a semi-circle,
pass each other and then run into the vacated spot on the far side.</li>

</ul>
<p class="styling">STYLING: Hands should blend into handhold required for following formation (i.e. wave or line).</p>
<p class="timing">Timing: From ocean waves, centers, 4 steps; cross run, 6; ends, 4; ends cross run, 6.</p>
