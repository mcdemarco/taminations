<h2>Teacup Chain</h2>
<p>Starting formation - Static Square, or proceeding from everyone
doing a <a href="../ms/turn_thru.html"> Left Arm Turn</a> with partner. </p>
<p>The caller will specify two ladies to move to the center at the start of the call,
e.g., "Head ladies center for a Teacup Chain". For the rest of the definition,
these two ladies will be called the "specified ladies". </p>
<p>
<span id="TeacupChain1">The specified ladies (both Head ladies or both Side ladies) move to the center and
<a href="../ms/star.html"> Star
Right</a> three-quarters to meet their corners for a <a href="../ms/turn_thru.html"> Left Arm
Turn</a>. At the same time, the other two ladies move to the right
around the perimeter of the square to their corners,
and do a <a href="../ms/turn_thru.html"> Right Arm Turn</a>.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="TeacupChain2">Following the Arm Turns, the specified ladies move around the perimeter of the square
to their new corners for a Right Arm Turn, while the other ladies go to the center and
<a href="../ms/star.html">
Star Left</a> once and a quarter to meet their new corners for a Right Arm Turn. </span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="TeacupChain3">The specified ladies then move to the center and Star Left once and a quarter to their
new corners for a Right Arm Turn, while the other ladies move to their new corners (around
the perimeter of the square) for a Left Arm Turn. </span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="TeacupChain4">Finally, the specified ladies move to their new corners
(their original partners) for
either a <a href="../ms/courtesy_turn.html"> Courtesy Turn</a>
 or a Left Arm Turn leading into the next command, while the other
ladies move to the center and Star Right three-quarters to meet their new corners (their
original partners) for either a Courtesy Turn or a Left Arm Turn leading into the next
command. Everyone finishes with his/her original partner. </span>
</p>
<p>If the caller desires the men to execute the ladies part and vice versa, as described
above, the starting formation is a Static Square with all couples half-sashayed, or
proceeding from everyone doing a Left Arm Turn with their partner. The proper call is the
"Head/Side Men Center for a Teacup Chain". </p>
<p class="styling">STYLING: Center dancers turning in  star patterns use  hands up styling. All turns with outside dancers are  forearm turns. When not leading into another command, a  courtesy turn, as previously described, is used at the conclusion of the call. Outside dancers (usually the gents) dance with arms swinging naturally from one forearm turn to the next, being as graceful as possible in a movement that offers little other than pivot movements. Ladies may enhance the styling of this basic through  skirt work with outside hand.</p>
<p class="timing">Timing: 32</p>
