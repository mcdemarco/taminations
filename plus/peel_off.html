<h2>Peel Off</h2>
<p>Starting formation - Tandem Couples, Box Circulate, or Z formation.</p>
<p>Lead dancers walk in an approximate semicircle, away from the center of the starting formation, to
become the ends of a four-dancer line. Trailing dancers step forward as necessary to become centers of
the same line and U Turn Back, turning away from the center of the starting formation. All dancers end
in a four-dancer line. Each dancer will have turned half (180&deg;) to end facing the opposite
direction from which they started. Peel Off from Tandem Couples ends in a One-Faced Line. Peel Off
from Box Circulate or a Z ends in a Two-Faced Line.</p>
<p>Notes: Everyone can <a href="anything_and_roll.html">Roll</a> after a Peel Off. Dancers move in a smooth, continuous motion that cannot
be fractionalized. The center of the ending formation is the same as the center of the starting formation.</p>
<p>Two dancers who form a Tandem and have a center to work away from can Peel Off as if in a box
circulate formation (e.g., the ends of waves or the points of diamonds). They finish as a couple on a line
midway between the original lead and trailing positions.</p>
<p class="styling">STYLING: Arms should be held in  natural dance position and ready to assume appropriate position for the next call. It is important that lead dancers move slightly forward before starting the "peeling" motion.</p>
<p class="timing">Timing: 4</p>
